        Hi my name is Jonathan Telep. I graduated from Ohio University in 2018 with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. During my collegiate career, I lived through arguable the most
        political turmoil presidential election of 2016. I heard and saw families get in to heated arguments about which candidate is better. Families were separated and friendships were
        broken on the regards of support of a presidential candidate. Debating is always the best way to inform a person your beliefs and what should happen with our government. Agreeing
        to disagree also is very important. Respecting the other's choice and seeing where they come from.
